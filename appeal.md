`@40000s || 792927863468064818`

Hello, 

I (along with @40000s whom I will be referring to as "Funny" as that was their old username), were recently banned and terminated from taunahi a few days ago regarding an exploit a friend found in your leaderboard API. 

I will begin by explaining the timeline of events.

October 21st 2024:
-# most if not all conversation happened in a private server which has the members Ciel, Sun3k, myself, quint and sideload. - quint and sideload were not part of this.

The user sun3k (in screenshots has the nickname "man" \|\| 683364835685040143) set the user cielmc ("Ciel" \|\| 441474795100438530)'s farming statistics to negative int limit <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/a4d4701d.png>
I (apon waking up) checked the channel to see what people were doing.  <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/55599249.png>
I (because it causes no harm and as a developer I'm aware its quite easy to revert the lb to a backup or just remove the troll posts + I was planning on making this ticket that day regarding it anyways however ended up getting busy irl) <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/a7a0c03e.png>

I was initially set to 1.9k <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/639f3887.png> and then later on was set to 19k - as a joke and to freak out the user Funny in + chat <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/c711f95d.png> <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/add9eb9f.png>

After talking to funny - I decided to dm him asking for an ign <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/046991f6.png> man and ciel (and I) wanted to see what would happen if we set the LB to 2b so we were doing some random trolls (we realized the lb updates every 2 hours not 1 so we were wasting time and, not using my best judgement after just waking up - decided to join in on this) 

<https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/0c2b55b1.png> Funny was then set to 40k hours, with a random username (forgive me as I forget their username) and ciel being at int limit and negative int limit respectively

 I, along with the random user and funny, were banned and our access to taunahi.net was removed (I am not even using taunahi at this moment so I'm not sure if I lost my access) 

I lost interest in the conversation so I left chat - most of the cracking process I have little knowledge or understanding about since I only decompile mods and look for R.A.T's for RatterScanner, not purposely crack any (I have no need and I'm against cracking which is why I never provided any help or my taunahi jar to him when asked) 

Later on this was sent <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/af879d7d.png> showing sun3k talking to taunahi <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/7f08786a.png> 
-# the first screenshot leads me to believe you thought I, or someone else cracked it

this is the latest screenshot <https://cdn.axle.coffee/images/858b3b4b.png> in the channel perhaps some of the obf you will understand <:thumbs_up:1013653640638124032> 

here is a screenshot I took days ago <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/883847058493149195/1300255993137201234/Screenshot_20241027_203259_Gallery.jpg?ex=67202d42&is=671edbc2&hm=5f722a1136b79903e3e2278e82354a3485a200bb2e22712630ed822e2c227110&> showing him cracking something - not sure

Regardless, I would like to reiterate that I, nor Funny, had any part to play in cracking your mod. 
**I, along with RatterScanner Development, where I am staff at, are against cracking** 
The **only** reason I joined in to the conversation (aside from having bad judgement) was because, as a developer,  would presume that your leaderboard data is stored and can be easily sorted threw/compared to a backup.

After having a wonderful chat with Alex a few months ago regarding adding taunahi to @Ratter Scanner's safe list I have absolutely **no** reason to even think about cracking Taunahi, nor do I have sufficient knowing regarding reverse engineering something like this. 

Regarding Funny, he has never been involved with any of this process and I only asked him if he wanted any as a **joke**. if I recall correctly he was a Server Booster for months/years in Taunahi and had no reason to crack the mod since both of us had bought and used our own copies of Taunahi+. 

I am terribly sorry for sun3k and my own actions and my delay in writing this appeal. 

Cheers!
